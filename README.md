If Any Variable Is Changed Such As Location On Earth, Start Time, Time Duration, Or Time Increment, All Planetary Data Will Load Again.
Just Keep In Mind How Many Data Points Can Be Generated. If You Are Looking For A Certain Time That Something Happens, It's Best To Start With
A Large Time Increment And Then Narrow It Down Using Smaller Time Durations and Time Increments.
